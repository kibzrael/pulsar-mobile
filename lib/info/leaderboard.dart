          "It works by giving the participants of challenge points that will be utilized in the ranking of their position. The points will be awarded via variable measures that will be decided by us (the creators of the challenge). This includes but is not limited to the number of reposts, likes, and shares the particular user has gained during the running of the challenge.\nThe points will be awarded in real-time and the users can be able to track the changes whenever they are online. This means that the participant's position on the leaderboard will be changing relative to other users. For example, if a user is number one at a particular time this may change if another user has gained more points. Or if one was below the top ten and a user gets disqualified other users' positions are going to be affected.\nThe users are solely responsible for looking for likes and other key variables for them to win a particular challenge. Users are allowed to share their posts on other platforms to get points. This is on their own and the company is not liable for any losses incurred by doing so."),
